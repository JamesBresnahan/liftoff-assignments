## Submission Instructions

### Overview
    One of the most difficult parts about starting a home garden for any sort of casual hobbyist or novice are the intricacies
    of carrying for various plants and their interactions with one another. How much should I water thyme, how much sun do tomatoes need,
    what other herbs grow well with dill? These are all critical questions with straightforward answers, but who has the time
    or the energy to invest in such minutiae, when really all you want are a handful of basil leaves a couple of times a year to
    make pesto?

    I propose to create an app that allows a user to create a digital planter box. They can choose from a variety of vegetables
    and herbs, receiving feedback about recommended companion plants that can boost their garden or combinations to avoid.
    Furthermore they can receive watering reminders based off their selections. Finally, they can add plant profiles to a database
    that others can access, creating effectively a public gardening library.

### Features

    Add plants: users can add to a database of various plant species each with fields for watering, companion plants, non-companion plants, etc.
    Search plants: users can search the database for specific plant species
    Create a Garden: users can create a garden box and receive feedback based on their selections.

    Java
    SpringBoot
    Thymeleaf
    BootStrap

### What I'll Have to Learn
